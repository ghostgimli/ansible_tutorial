[Verse 1]
Immortal temptation
Takes over my mind
Condemned
Falling weak on my knees
Summon the strength
Of mayhem

[Chorus 1]
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames
I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death!
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery
Destiny chasing time

[Verse 2]
Inherit the nightmare
Surrounded by fate
Canâ€™t run away
Keep walking the line
Between the light
Led astray
